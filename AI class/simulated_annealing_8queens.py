Simulated Annealing implementation for solving the 8-queens problem
Many variants of the algorithm exist, but the implementation is done to make sure it is close to the AI Textbook 
(Russell & Norvig) version

SA_temp = 0.2  # the temperature parameter (t); it is the schedule input and it determines the rate of acceptance of (worse) solutions
'''
Try to vary the value of SA_temp, don't try to go beyond the value 1.0 and also avoid setting a value of 0.0 and below
What do you observe if the value is very low, for example 0.01? Try to run the SA algorithm for at least 20 times with SA_temp = 0.01.
What do you observe from these runs? Compare your observation with another observation if you run the SA algorithm with
SA_temp value of 1.0.
